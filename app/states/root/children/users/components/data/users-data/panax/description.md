Panax is a stack of technologies to generate applications automatically based on a relational data model. Customization and extensibility is done via configuration, nevertheless Panax aim is to generate an usable app with less possible interaction from the developer (based on heuristics, assumptions, etc).

One of the most important UI for an application are forms, therefore we heavily rely on angular-formly to ease it's generation.
