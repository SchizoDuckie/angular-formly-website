## Examples

We LOVE examples! It's extremely helpful to everyone involved, so yes, please create examples :-) Follow these steps:

1. Create an example on jsbin by cloning [this template](http://jsbin.com/panovu/edit)
2. Make sure it's awesome and clean
3. Make a PR to [examples.json](https://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly-website/edit/master/examples.json)
  - The "jsbinId" is the unique part of the jsbin url ("panovu" is the jsbinId for the template)
  - Feel free to add "keywords" to the entry, this will make it easier to find
  - The "slug" is what will appear in the URL for the example. Make it:
    1) easy to remember
    2) separated by dashes
    3) unique for the category
4. Wait patiently while it's evaluated :-)
5. Cheer with us! Formly rocks! :-)
